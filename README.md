# This is my recruitment test App. Even tho this went really poorly and probably I won't get this job, this project was really fun and humbling... 


A list of things I learned:
- Like 0.001 of Apis Topic,
- Small part of Django Rest Framework,
- How to get data from forms,
- How to connect to API..., 
- How to create enviroment variables,
- and more....
