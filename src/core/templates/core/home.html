            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 text-white">Hello there,

                This is an app I had to make as part of recrutation test.
                So... I will be honest, this project is bad, I mean really bad.

                I will explain why.
                First of all, description:
                While using any python web framework I had to make an app that will manage a collection of books.
                This app should allow it's users to manually add, edit and delete Books. A simple CRUD.
                Also app should have a functionality that would allow to import Books from Google Api.
                Frontend could finished with Bootstrap.</p>
            <br>
            <h5 class="display-6 fw-bold text-white">Part 1:</h5>
            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 text-white">
                1) So this went pretty smooth. I done all the models. At the begining Book model had (in my opinion)
                properly chosen fields. Later I changed them to CharFields, bacause of this Api thing ;)</p>
            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 text-white">
                2) I had to create 2 views: a view that will allow user to edit a Book - Done. A 2nd View that would
                list all the books and allow to search and filter them, by information in model. Form and realated view
                are working, but Im quite sure this could be done better.</p>

            <h5 class="display-6 fw-bold text-white">Part 2:</h5>
            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 text-white">
                1) This was the hardest part for me. First of all, this was my first contact with Apis. The outcome of
                this, is this frankenstein code (GoogleBooks) in related view. I still dont understand it, and the view
                I wrote is crashing and is buggy. I had a chance to learn a lot while doing this tho. Some requests
                library, serializers , deserialize, generating api views, a little bit of postman, json, and more... I
                tried like 3 different aproaches, function views, class views and django rest framework...
                The overall effect is bad :(</p>
            <h5 class="display-6 fw-bold text-white">Part 3:</h5>
            <p class="fs-5 mb-4 text-white">1) This Part was basically done for me by django rest framework. I would
                like to mention that this was my 1st contact with DRF. It works only because of DRF's documentation and
                some YT tutorial.</p>
